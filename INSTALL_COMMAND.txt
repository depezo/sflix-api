Run this command on your server to install without downloading Chromium:

PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true npm install --omit=optional

If the above still fails, try this alternative approach:

1. First, install everything except puppeteer:
npm install axios cheerio cors express puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth user-agents

2. Then install puppeteer-core instead of puppeteer:
npm install puppeteer-core

3. Update your code to use puppeteer-core with system Chrome.
